        <p>
            As we celebrate another year together, I want to remind you just how much you mean to me. Every moment we've shared, every laugh, every tear, has made our bond stronger than ever. You are my heart, my home, and my reason for everything I do. <br><br>
            These poems are my way of expressing the depth of my love for you. Each one is a reflection of how I feel about you and how grateful I am to have you by my side. <br><br>
            I love you more than words could ever convey, and I can't wait to spend forever with you.  <br><br>
            With all my love, <br>
            Your Forever
